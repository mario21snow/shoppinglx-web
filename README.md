This project deals with developing a Virtual website ‘E-commerce Website’. It provides the user with a list of the various products available for 
purchase in the store. For the convenience of online shopping, a shopping cart is provided to the user. After the selection of the goods, it is sent
for the order confirmation process. The system is implemented using Python’s web framework Django. To develop an e-commerce website, it is necessary
to study and understand many technologies.
The scope of the project will be limited to some functions of the e-commerce website. It will display products, customers can select catalogs and 
select products, and can remove products from their cart specifying the quantity of each item. Selected items will be collected in a cart. At checkout,
the item on the card will be presented as an order. Customers can pay for the items in the cart to complete an order. This project has great future scope.
The project also provides security with the use of login ID and passwords, so that no unauthorized users can access your account. The only authorized person 
who has the appropriate access authority can access the software.
Django framework and SQLite database which comes by default with Django.
